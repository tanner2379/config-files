## Configuration files I use for setting up various programs on my computer/workspace
<strong>This repository exists purely for my own benefit and some of the files herein may contain large sections of code/config that are not my own. The only reason this is public is in the off chance someone benefits from having these configurations as a starting point. If there is significant, non-trivial overlap with one of YOUR configs and you wish me to take that file down/make it private, I will.</strong> No breaking changes will be announced. This repository is subject to change without warning.

I work full time using the init.vim, tmux.conf, and coc-settings.nvim files. If you are looking to ditch your current editor and want a good starting point for getting into nvim, check those out. At some point I might document the functionality, but as of now you will just have to read through the files and the plugin documentation. <strong>Install list: nvim, tmux, xclip, vim-plug, the_silver_searcher.</strong> The rest will be auto installed upon starting nvim or running <strong>:PlugInstall</strong> from within the editor.

te is a bash script that launches tmux into a vs-code-like state, with an nvim editor on top and a terminal on the bottom.

All of this is Gruvbox color schemed
