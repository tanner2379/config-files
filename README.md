## Configuration files I use for setting up various programs on my computer/workspace
### This repository exists purely for my own benefit and some of the files herein may contain large sections, or be almost entirely, code/config that are not my own. The only reason this is public is in the off chance someone benefits from having these configurations as a starting point.

I work full time using the init.vim, tmux.conf, gitmux.conf, and coc-settings.nvim files. If you are looking to ditch your current editor and want a good starting point for getting into nvim, check those out. At some point I might document the functionality, but as of now you will just have to read through the files and the plugin documentation. <strong>Install list: nvim, tmux, gitmux, vim-plug, the_silver_searcher.</strong> The rest will be auto installed upon starting nvim

te is a bash script that launches tmux into a vs-code-like state, with an nvim editor on top and a terminal on the bottom.

<strong>All other files in this repository are subject to heavy change as I am currently configuring them myself and have not been living in them for very long. As mentioned, this repository is meant for my sole benefit so I don't have to send myself config files via email. If there is significant, non-trivial overlap with one of YOUR configs and you wish me to take that file down/make it private, I will.</strong>
